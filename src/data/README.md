# Data

Data types are defined in [types.ts][types] and inside
[components][components] directory, and are used to generate JSON Schema
for each category (.json file).

Use [Visual Studio Code][code] (used by https://github.dev) or any other
[editor][editor] that supports JSON Schemas.

Open any data file, hover your mouse pointer over the keys and values,
and press `Ctrl` + `Space` to get some help while adding/editing the files.

Look at the files inside [components][components] folder to see examples.

[types]: ./types.ts
[components]: ../components/
[code]: https://code.visualstudio.com/
[editor]: https://json-schema.org/implementations.html#editors
